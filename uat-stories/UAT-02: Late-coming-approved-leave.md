**Requirement:** FR-01 (Late Coming Flag)

**User story:**
As an HR Manager, I want a day of approved leave to be left out of the late-coming count so that employees are not flagged unfairly.

**Assumptions:**
Late = check-in from 9.41 AM. Approved full day leave is never counted as late. count resets each calender month.

**Test Steps:**
- [ ] 1. Record Employee C checking in at 9:45 AM on two different working days this month.
      Expected: Late count shows 2; no flag
- [ ] 2. Approve a full day of leave for Employee C on a third day, and record a late check-in (10:15 AM) on that day.
      Expected: Leave day is not counted; late count stays at 2; no flag
- [ ] 3. Record Employee C checking at 9:45 AM on a fourth working day.
      Expected: Late count shoes 3; HR flag appears on C's record and C is in the HR flagged List.

**Result** Not Tested
